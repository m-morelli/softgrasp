robotic hand</DIV><p></p> </p><p>With reference to Fig. 1, a hand is modeled as a collection of serial robots called <i>limbs</i> (simple chains of links connected through revolute or prismatic joints) manipulating an <i>object</i>. An inertial frame <img src="softgrasp_gs_workflow_eq24998.png" alt="$\{A\} = \{O_a; x_a, y_a, z_a\}$"> is attached to the palm. A reference frame <img src="softgrasp_gs_workflow_eq83938.png" alt="$\{B\} = \{O_b; x_b, y_b, z_b\}$">, referred to as the body frame, is fixed on the grasped object. The object is in contact with all or some of the links of the limbs and, eventually, the palm. No distinction is made whether the contacting links are at the extremities of the limb or not.</p><p>On the i- <i>th</i> of the <i>p</i> contact points, a frame <img src="softgrasp_gs_workflow_eq32025.png" alt="$\{C_i^h\} = \{O_{c_i^h}; x_{c_i^h}, y_{c_i^h}, z_{c_i^h}\}$"> is attached to the finger link and a frame <img src="softgrasp_gs_workflow_eq82450.png" alt="$\{C_i^o\} = \{O_{c_i^o}; x_{c_i^o}, y_{c_i^o}, z_{c_i^o}\}$"> is attached to the object. These frames play a key role in the mathematical description of the hand/object interaction, more specifically, in the computation of the Grasp matrix, the hand Jacobian matrix and the wrench bases, that play a key role in the definition of the equilibrium and congruence equations of hand and object.</p><p>The <i>contact</i> between the hand and the object can be interpreted as a motion constraint. Typically, depending on the nature of materials involved, not all the directions of motions are limited. For the case of contact point without friction, only the direction normal to the contact surface is forbidden; the <i>hard finger</i>, allows the presence of three components of force, on the contact, but no moment; the <i>soft finger</i> adds the possibility to transmit a moment around the normal vector to the contact surface. The hard&#8211;finger model is used when there is significant contact friction, but the contact patch is small, so that no appreciable friction moment exists. The soft&#8211;finger model is used in situations in which the surface friction and the contact patch are large enough to generate significant friction forces and a friction moment about the contact normal.</p><p> In general, there are more motion constraints than degrees of
freedom and this makes the grasping system statically indeterminate (or
<i>hyperstatic</i>). To address this problem, a contact force model is
adopted which is linear in the interference between the hand and the
object. A <i>virtual contact spring</i> is considered as interposed
between the link and the object at each contact point. For the
i-<i>th</i> contact, the characteristics of the virtual spring are
described by a constant <i>stiffness matrix</i> <img

%% SoftGrasp Concepts and Workflow
%

%% Basic Assumptions
%
% SoftGrasp relies on the analytical framework introduced in [12] and
% extensively explained in [14], which draws upon previous works on
% whole-body defective grasps [8], [15], [16] and assumes the _contact
% information is known, by either planning (from e.g., OpenRAVE/OpenGRASP)
% or sensing_.

%%
% A basic assumption is that all bodies are modelled as rigid. Thanks to
% this, it is possible to use the wide variety of mathematical tools
% developed to describe rigid body motions. Compliance, e.g. the softness
% of the contact fingertips and/or the grasped object, is modeled through
% virtual springs.

%%
% SoftGrasp deals with modeling, analysis and optimization of
% _quasi-static_ grasps and dynamic effects such as viscous damping, are
% disregarded in the model. Note that dynamics do not typically play a
% major role in the control of grasping, where motions are usually slow.

%%
% The investigation of the system capabilities, e.g. the contact forces on
% the object actually controllable by the hand, is separate to the
% restriction imposed by the friction limits, and it is assumed that a
% subsequent classical force optimization procedure can lead to a feasible
% solution. In other words, the grasp analysis is performed in the
% assumption that the system of forces grasping the object is _force
% closure_, ensuring that grasping forces can always be exerted on the
% object such that both balance equations and contact force constraints are
% not violated. SoftGrasp provides methods for checking force-closure and
% for controlling grasping forces so as to avoid the violation of contact
% constraints in general cooperating mechanisms.

%
% With reference to Fig. 1, a hand is modeled as a collection of serial
% robots called _limbs_ (simple chains of links connected through revolute
% or prismatic joints) manipulating an _object_. An inertial frame $\{A\} =
% \{O_a; x_a, y_a, z_a\}$ is attached to the palm. A reference frame $\{B\}
% = \{O_b; x_b, y_b, z_b\}$, referred to as the body frame, is fixed on the
% grasped object. The object is in contact with all or some of the links of
% the limbs and, eventually, the palm. No distinction is made whether the
% contacting links are at the extremities of the limb or not.

%%
% On the i- _th_ of the _p_ contact points, a frame $\{C_i^h\} =
% \{O_{c_i^h}; x_{c_i^h}, y_{c_i^h}, z_{c_i^h}\}$ is attached to the finger
% link and a frame $\{C_i^o\} = \{O_{c_i^o}; x_{c_i^o}, y_{c_i^o},
% z_{c_i^o}\}$ is attached to the object. These frames play a key role in
% the mathematical description of the hand/object interaction, more
% specifically, in the computation of the Grasp matrix, the hand Jacobian
% matrix and the wrench bases, that play a key role in the definition of
% the equilibrium and congruence equations of hand and object.

%%
% The _contact_ between the hand and the object can be interpreted as a
% motion constraint. Typically, depending on the nature of materials
% involved, not all the directions of motions are limited. For the case of
% contact point without friction, only the direction normal to the contact
% surface is forbidden; the _hard finger_, allows the presence of three
% components of force, on the contact, but no moment; the _soft finger_
% adds the possibility to transmit a moment around the normal vector to the
% contact surface. The hard–finger model is used when there is significant
% contact friction, but the contact patch is small, so that no appreciable
% friction moment exists. The soft–finger model is used in situations in
% which the surface friction and the contact patch are large enough to
% generate significant friction forces and a friction moment about the
% contact normal.
%
% <html> In general, there are more motion constraints than degrees of
% freedom and this makes the grasping system statically indeterminate (or
% <i>hyperstatic</i>). To address this problem, a contact force model is
% adopted which is linear in the interference between the hand and the
% object. A <i>virtual contact spring</i> is considered as interposed

%%
% The above concepts of limb, hand and object have a direct counterpart in
% SoftGrasp. They are represented by instances of the classes |Limb|,
% |Hand| and |ManipulatedObject|, respectively.

%%
% A |Limb| object contains the kinematic description of a limb. An
% extensible design approach known as Factory Method Pattern [17] allows to
% add support for arbitrary kinematic-description conventions, without
% requiring any modification to the |Limb| class. Support for
% screw-theory-, Denavit-Hartenberg- and
% <http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/model URDF>-based (serial) robot
% descriptions is already provided by SoftGrasp.

%%
% A |Hand| is made up of a collection of |Limb| objects. An homogeneous
% transformation represents the inertial frame $\{A\}$ attached to the
% palm. Hence, a |Hand| object encapsulates the complete geometrical
% description of the hand model.

%%
% A |ManipulatedObject| instance contains an homogeneous transformation
% that represents the body frame $\{B\}$.

%%
% Note that, since SoftGrasp assumes that the contact information is known,
% the information about the actual shape of links and/or objects (that play
% a key role in software simulations such as collision detection and
% contact determination) is not required.

%%
% To represent the contact information, different concepts are defined. One
% that plays a basic role in the contact definition procedure is the _Point
% Of Interest_, or POI. A POI is represented by an instance of the class
% |POI|, which embeds information about position and orientation of a
% normalized Gauss frame attached to the point itself and expressed in
% local coordinates, i.e., with respect to the fingerpad or the manipulated
% object, depending on where the point is placed. When placed onto a link,
% the POI can be used to model the _location of a contact_ with an object
% in a grasp and the normalized Gauss frame represents $\{C_i^h\}$. When
% placed onto the object, the POI can be used to locate a point of contact
% with a hand in a grasp and the normalized Gauss frame represents
% $\{C_i^o\}$.

%%
% |Glove| and |Cover| classes encapsulate the information that specifies
% how a collection of |POI| instances is associated to a given |Hand| or
% |ManipulatedObject| instance, respectively. A |Glove| instance matches
% the concept of a _coating_ to be applied to the hand and decorated with a
% number of POIs drawn at specific locations on the finger phalanges (Fig.
% 2). A |Cover| instance matches the concept of a coating to be applied to
% the object and decorated with a number of POIs drawn at desired locations
% (Fig. 3).
%
% The (conceptual) gloved hand in Fig. 2 is represented by a
% |HandWithGlove| instance. In other words, the aggregation of a |Hand|
% instance with a |Glove| instance is specified by an object of type
% |HandWithGlove|. Similarly, the aggregation of a |ManipulatedObject|
% instance with a |Cover| instance is specified by an object of type
% |ObjectWithCover|, which represents the (conceptual) covered object in
% Fig. 3.

%%
% The information on the contact locations expressed by |POI|, |Glove| and
% |Cover| instances must then be complemented by contact properties such
% as, e.g., constrained motion directions, contact stiffness and frictional
% attributes. These properties are encapsulated in concrete specializations
% of the |Contact| class. The classes |HardFingerContact|,
% |SoftFingerContact| and |CompleteConstraintContact| are already included
% in SoftGrasp to enable modeling of hard/soft finger and
% complete-constraint concepts, respectively.

%%
% To complete the specification of the contact information, |POI| objects
% of both the |Glove| and |Cover| instances must be suitably paired and
% each pair must be associated to a kind of |Contact|. This is done by
% using one instance of the |ContactStructure| class. This class
% encapsulates the information of which |POI| object on the |Glove|
% instance is paired to which |POI| object on the |Cover| instance, and
% which contact properties are assigned to each pair of points (Fig. 4).

%%
% |Glove|, |Cover| and |ContactStructure| classes decouple the hand and
% object model from the complete specification of contact information,
% which is specific to a grasp task. In this way it is possible to use the
% same |Hand| and |ManipulatedObject| instances to model any number of
% grasping configurations (Fig. 5).

%% SoftGrasp Tools for Grasp Analysis and Optimization
%
% The concepts and the modeling procedures above enable the specification
% of the models and data needed to perform analysis and control of
% grasping. Analysis and optimization functionalities are not provided by a
% single-class implementation. Rather, they are organized in composable
% solvers, in order to avoid too deep class hierarchies and hence enhance
% extensibility, maintainability and foster code reuse.

%%
% Fig. 6 shows a (simplified) UML class diagram view that summarizes the
% available solvers in SoftGrasp and the relationships among them.
%

% height="auto"><DIV><B>Fig. 6</B> Available solvers in SoftGrasp to
% perform classification, analysis and optimization of cooperating arms,
% closed-chain mechanisms and underactuated hands (UML class diagram of
% <tt>GraspSolver</tt>).</DIV><p></p> </html>

%%
% The |GraspSolver| class provides essential functionalities common to all
% the analysis solvers, such as the computation of the Grasp matrix, the
% hand Jacobian matrix and the wrench bases. |GraspSolver| is an astract
% class and hence cannot be instantiated directly; three concrete
% specializations are provided by SoftGrasp.

%%
% |ClosedChainsSolver| is a kind of |GraspSolver| that computes the above
% manipulability subspaces, both in the kinematic and in force domain, of
% rigid-body closed-chain mechanisms with passive joints.

%%
% |GraspAnalysisSolver| is a kind of |GraspSolver| that TODO

%%
% |GraspClassificator| is a kind of |GraspSolver| that provides a basic
% classification of grasping systems, as in [19]. The classification
% provides insight into the physical meaning of the null spaces of the
% Grasp matrix and the hand Jacobian matrix. It can be used as a basis to
% implement further grasp classification criteria for advanced planning
% and/or reasoning.

%%
% The |GraspForceOptimizer| provides the functionality to compute an
% optimal distribution of the grasping forces according to the
% unconstrained minimization approach with barrier strategy described
% above. Instances of this solver are initialized with two results from the
% |GraspAnalysisSolver|, i.e., the matrices representing the subspace of
% _controllable internal forces_ and the _contact force transmission_ of
% the external wrench. The |ContactStructure| instance of
% |GraspAnalysisSolver| is also required as input parameter by the
% |GraspForceOptimizer| constructor. In this way, all the contact
% information is accessible to the internal optimization routines of the
% |GraspForceOptimizer| instance.
